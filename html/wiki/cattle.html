<p><strong>Cattle</strong> or <strong>oxen (Bos taurus)</strong> are large, domesticated, bovid ungulates. 
    They are prominent modern members of the subfamily Bovinae and the most widespread species of the genus Bos. 
    Mature female cattle are referred to as <strong cows></strong>  and mature male cattle are referred to as bulls. 
    Colloquially, young female cattle <strong> (heifers)</strong>, young male cattle <strong> (bullocks)</strong>, and
     castrated male cattle (steers) are also referred to as "cows".</p>
    <br>
    <p>Cattle are commonly raised as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock">livestock</a> for meat (beef or veal, see beef cattle),
         for milk (see dairy cattle), and for hides, which are used to make leather. 
        They are used as riding animals and draft animals (oxen or bullocks, which pull carts, plows and other implements).
         Another product of cattle is their dung, which can be used to create manure or fuel.
          In some regions, such as parts of India, cattle have significant religious significance.
         Cattle, mostly small breeds such as the Miniature Zebu, are also kept as pets.</p>

         <p>Around 10,500 years ago, taurine cattle were domesticated from as few as 80 wild aurochs progenitors in central Anatolia, the Levant and Western Iran.[1]
             A separate domestication event occurred in the Indian subcontinent, which gave rise to zebu. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), there are approximately 1.5 billion cattle in the world as of 2018.[2] 
             Cattle are the main source of greenhouse gas emissions from livestock, and are responsible for around 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions.[3][4]
             In 2009, cattle became one of the first livestock animals to have a fully mapped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome">genome</a> .[5]</p>

<p>Different types of cattle are common to different geographic areas. 
    Taurine cattle are found primarily in Europe and temperate areas of Asia, the Americas, and Australia.
     Zebus (also called indicine cattle) are found primarily in India and tropical areas of Asia, America, and Australia.
      Sanga cattle are found primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. These types (which are sometimes classified as separate species or subspecies) 
      are further divided into over 1,000 recognized breeds.</p>

      <h1 class="cruel">Taxonomy</h1>
      <hr>
      <address>See also: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bos">Bos</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae">Bovinae</a>
        <br>
        <p>Cattle were originally identified as three separate species: Bos taurus, the European or "taurine" cattle (including similar types from Africa and Asia); 
            Bos indicus, the Indicine or "zebu"; and the extinct Bos primigenius, the aurochs. The aurochs is ancestral to both zebu and taurine cattle.[6]
             They were later reclassified as one species, Bos taurus, with the aurochs, zebu, and taurine cattle as subspecies.[7]
              However, this taxonomy is contentious and some sources prefer the separate species classification, such as the American Society of Mammalogists' Mammal Diversity Database.</p>
              <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Zubron2.jpg" alt="">
              <p>Complicating the matter is the ability of cattle to interbreed with other closely related species. Hybrid individuals and even breeds exist, not only between taurine cattle and zebu
                 (such as the sanga cattle (Bos taurus africanus x Bos indicus), but also between one or both of these and some other members of the genus Bos – yaks (the dzo or yattle[10]), banteng, and gaur.
                  Hybrids such as the beefalo breed can even occur between taurine cattle and either species of bison, leading some authors to consider them part of the genus Bos, as well.[11]
                   The hybrid origin of some types may not be obvious – for example, genetic testing of the Dwarf Lulu breed, the only taurine-type cattle in Nepal, found them to be a mix of taurine cattle, zebu, and yak.[12]
                    However, cattle cannot be successfully hybridized with more distantly related bovines such as water buffalo or African buffalo.</p>
                    <h1>Terminology</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>In general, the same words are used in different parts of the world, but with minor differences in the definitions. 
                        The terminology described here contrasts the differences in definition between the United Kingdom and other British-influenced parts of the world such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and the United States.[20] </p>
                        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/S%C3%A4rk%C3%A4nniemi_-_cow.jpg/1280px-S%C3%A4rk%C3%A4nniemi_-_cow.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>The aurochs originally ranged throughout Europe, North Africa, and much of Asia. 
                            In historical times, its range became restricted to Europe, and the last known individual died in Mazovia, Poland, in about 1627.[13] 
                            Breeders have attempted to recreate cattle of similar appearance to aurochs by crossing traditional types of domesticated cattle, creating the Heck cattle breed.</p>
                            <li>A young female before she has had a calf of her own[21] and who is under three years of age is called a heifer (/ˈhɛfər/ HEF-ər).[22]
                                 A young female that has had only one calf is occasionally called a first-calf heifer. Heiferettes are either first-calf heifers or a subset thereof without potential to become lineage dams, depending on whose definition is operative.</li>
                            <li>Young cattle (regardless of sex) are called calves until they are weaned, then weaners until they are a year old in some areas; in other areas, particularly with male beef cattle, they may be known as feeder calves or feeders. 
                                After that, they are referred to as yearlings or stirks[23] if between one and two years of age.</li>
                            <li>In all cattle species, a female twin of a bull usually becomes an infertile partial intersex, and is called a freemartin</li>
                            <li>The adjective applying to cattle in general is usually bovine. The terms bull, cow and calf are also used by extension to denote the sex or age of other large animals, including whales, hippopotamuses, camels, elk and elephants.</li>
                            <br>
                            <h1>Etymology</h1>
                            <hr>
                            <p>Cattle did not originate as the term for bovine animals.
                                 It was borrowed from Anglo-Norman catel, itself from medieval Latin capitale 'principal sum of money, capital', itself derived in turn from Latin caput 'head'. 
                                 Cattle originally meant movable personal property, especially livestock of any kind, as opposed to real property (the land, which also included wild or small free-roaming animals such as chickens—they were sold as part of the land).[15][16]
                                  The word is a variant of chattel (a unit of personal property) and closely related to capital in the economic sense.[17][18][16] The term replaced earlier Old English feoh 'cattle, property', which survives today as fee (cf. German: Vieh, Dutch: vee, Gothic: faihu).</p>

                                  <h1>Characteristics</h1>
                                  <hr>
                                  <p>Cattle are ruminants, meaning their digestive system is highly specialized to allow the consumption of difficult to digest plants as food.
                                     Cattle have one stomach with four compartments, the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum, with the rumen being the largest compartment. The reticulum, the smallest compartment, is known as the "honeycomb".
                                      The omasum's main function is to absorb water and nutrients from the digestible feed. The omasum is known as the "many plies". 
                                    The abomasum is like the human stomach; this is why it is known as the "true stomach".</p>

                                    <p>Cattle are known for regurgitating and re-chewing their food, known as cud chewing, like most ruminants. While the animal is feeding, the food is swallowed without being chewed and goes into the rumen for storage until the animal can find a quiet place to continue the digestion process. 
                                        The food is regurgitated, a mouthful at a time, back up to the mouth, where the food, now called the cud, is chewed by the molars, grinding down the coarse vegetation to small particles. 
                                        The cud is then swallowed again and further digested by specialized microorganisms in the rumen. These microbes are primarily responsible for decomposing cellulose and other carbohydrates into volatile fatty acids cattle use as their primary metabolic fuel.
                                         The microbes inside the rumen also synthesize amino acids from non-protein nitrogenous sources, such as urea and ammonia. As these microbes reproduce in the rumen, older generations die and their cells continue on through the digestive tract. These cells are then partially digested in the small intestines, allowing cattle to gain a high-quality protein source.
                                          These features allow cattle to thrive on grasses and other tough vegetation.
                                          <h1>Behavior</h1>
                                          <hr>
                                          <p>Under natural conditions, calves stay with their mother until weaning at 8 to 11 months.
                                             Heifer and bull calves are equally attached to their mothers in the first few months of life.[88]
                                              Cattle are considered to be "hider" type animals, utilizing secluded areas more in the hours before calving and continued to use it more for the hour after calving. Cows that gave birth for the first time show a higher incidence of abnormal maternal behavior.</p>
                                              <strong>Reproductive behavior</strong>
<p>Semi-wild Highland cattle heifers first give birth at 2 or 3 years of age, and the timing of birth is synchronized with increases in natural food quality.
     Average calving interval is 391 days, and calving mortality within the first year of life is 5%.</p>
     <strong>Dominance and leadership</strong>
     <p>One study showed that over a 4-year period, dominance relationships within a herd of semi-wild highland cattle were very firm.
         There were few overt aggressive conflicts and the majority of disputes were settled by agonistic (non-aggressive, competitive) behaviors that involved no physical contact between opponents (e.g. threatening and spontaneous withdrawing). 
         Such agonistic behavior reduces the risk of injury. Dominance status depended on age and sex, with older animals generally being dominant to young ones and males dominant to females. Young bulls gained superior dominance status over adult cows when they reached about 2 years of age.[91]
